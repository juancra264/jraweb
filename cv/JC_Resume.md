Lead initiatives to integrate on-premise operations with multi-cloud services across all Mercado Libre regions.

Primary objective was to ensure maximum uptime and optimal performance to support seamless shipping operations. We connected over 500 warehouses and facilities, ranging from large distribution centers of 150,000 square meters to “nano” sites of just 100 square meters, all integrated into the Mercado Libre digital ecosystem. This included critical business applications and services. While the target uptime was 99.998%, most sites consistently achieved 100% availability due to our highly redundant architecture.

My team and I designed, deployed, and operated the entire solution, integrating a diverse set of vendors to deliver a robust, secure and scalable infrastructure. These vendors provided components such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), structured cabling, network switching, wireless access, firewalls, internet connectivity, and cloud integration.The shipping network spans five countries, and I served as the technical lead for Argentina, Colombia, and Chile, overseeing the implementation and operation of the connectivity solutions in these regions.
